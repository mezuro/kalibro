README - Kalibro
================

Kalibro aims to improve the use of source code metrics.
It is designed for easy integration with a metric collector tool and show the results in a friendlier way.
For that, it allows a metric specialist to create a configuration of thresholds associated with qualitative evaluation,
  including comments and recommendations.
These configurations are used to enhance metric results interpretation.

Kalibro is delivered with the proper configuration for running using Analizo, Checkstyle and CVSAnalY as source code
  analysis tools.

Analizo is a free and multi-language toolkit.
Analizo supports the extraction and calculation of a fair number of source code metrics, generation of dependency
  graphs, and software evolution analysis.
It efficiently parses source code written in C, C++ and Java.

Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard.
Kalibro uses its has many metric checks to analyze Java code.

CVSAnalY is a tool that extracts information out of source code repository logs and stores it into a database.
Kalibro uses its metric table to retrieve last commit metrics.
