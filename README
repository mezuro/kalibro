README - Kalibro
================

Kalibro aims to improve the use of source code metrics.
It is designed for easy integration with a metric collector tool and show the results in a friendlier way.
For that, it allows a metric specialist to create a configuration of thresholds associated with qualitative evaluation,
including comments and recommendations.
These configurations are used to enhance metric results interpretation.

Kalibro is delivered with the proper configuration for running using Analizo - a free and multi-language toolkit - as
the source code analysis tool.
Analizo supports the extraction and calculation of a fair number of source code metrics, generation of dependency
graphs, and software evolution analysis.
It efficiently parses source code written in C, C++ and Java.
